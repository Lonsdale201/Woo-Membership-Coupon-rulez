# Woo-Membership-Coupon-rulez
A simple plugin to coupons that allows woo membership users to optionally force to not use coupons if the membership provides a discount.

## How to install

Download, and upload the zip in your WordPress site. Activate the plugin. Select your coupon, and edit. In the General tab you will find a new checkbox **"Disable coupon for Woo Memberships"** check this box, and done.

## What does the plugin do?
Once you have checked this box and saved the coupon, when a logged in user wants to use the coupon, the extension will check if the user has a membership and if his or her memberships have a product discount set. It will match this with the products in the shopping cart. If it finds a match, it will notify the user that they cannot use the coupon.
